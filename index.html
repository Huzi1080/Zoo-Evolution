        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This website will serve as an interactive case study exploring how zoos have evolved 
          throughout history, displaying a timeline dating from early civilization to modern institutions.
          We will highlight historic events, conservation missions, and ethical concerns regarding the 
          Captivity and treatment of animals.
        </p>
     
          <strong>
            Have modern zoos transformed into ethical conservation spaces for wildlife, or do their historical pattern 
            indicate ethical concerns that remain unresolved in our society today?

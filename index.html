        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This website will serve as an interactive case study exploring how zoos have evolved 
          throughout history, displaying a timeline dating from early civilization to modern institutions.
          We will highlight historic events, conservation missions, and ethical concerns regarding the 
          Captivity and treatment of animals.
        </p>
     
          <strong>
            Have modern zoos transformed into ethical conservation spaces for wildlife, or do their historical pattern 
            indicate ethical concerns that remain unresolved in our society today?

        <h2>Philosophical Framework</h2>

        <div>
          <h3>Peter Singer — All Animals Are Equal</h3>
          <p>
            Singer argues that the capacity to suffer—not intelligence or species membership—is what gives a being moral 
            importance. Zoos must therefore justify captivity by proving that the suffering and restriction they impose are 
            outweighed by genuine welfare or conservation benefits. For many species, this justification fails.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Tom Regan — The Case for Animal Rights </h3>
          <p>
            Regan claims animals have inherent value and moral rights, including the right not to be treated as objects 
            or property. Captivity violates this right because it denies animals control, freedom, and self-determination. 
            Even improved enclosures still treat animals as exhibits, not individuals with rights.
          </p>
        </div>

         <div>
          <h3>Pepper — Privacy Rights & Animal Agency</h3>
         <p>
           Pepper emphasizes that animals care about privacy, choice, and control over their social exposure. 
           Traditional zoos deny animals the ability to withdraw from being viewed, which indicates that captivity 
           affects more than physical health—it affects psychological dignity.
         </p>
        </div>

       <div>
          <h3>Dale Jamieson — Zoos Revisited</h3>
            <p>
              He argues that zoos still rely on entertainment, even when they talk about conservation.
              Captivity restricts agency and freedom in ways that cannot be fully justified. He concludes 
              that the moral presumption should be against keeping animals in zoos at all unless necessary.

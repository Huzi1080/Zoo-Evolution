      <h2>Problematic Patterns within Zoos</h2>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Elephants in Captivity</h3>
        <p>
          Elephants require vast landscapes, social complexity, and the ability to move long distances. 
          In captivity, they often experience joint and foot pain, stress, and abnormal behaviors such as pacing and rocking, which is a sign of stress.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Singer: Emphasizes that captivity causes too much suffering, which needs to be justified</li>
          <li>Regan: Elephants' rights are violated by being held captive</li>
          <li>Pepper: Zoos tend to ignore their need for privacy and space.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Detroit Zoo elephant transfer demonstrates how institutions can prioritize ethics over entertainment.</p>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Gorillas & Social Stress</h3>
        <p>
          Gorillas, similar to humans, have complex social groups (families), and captivity disrupts their way of life. 
          regardless of zoos trying to improve their exhibits.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jamieson: captivity sends the message that humans may dominate other beings.</li>
          <li>Even with improved exhibits, ethical issues remain</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Big Cats in Limited Spaces</h3>
        <p>
          Despite improvements, most big cat enclosures remain far smaller than their 
          natural habitat, resulting in pacing and lack of freedom.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Singer: unnecessary suffering</li>
          <li>Regan: violation of rights</li>
          <li>Pepper: lack of agency and choice</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Examples of Positive Ethical Change</h2>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Detroit Zoo — Elephant Sanctuary Transfer</h3>
        <p>
          The Detroit Zoo realized that elephants cannot live ethically in captivity 
          and voluntarily moved them to a sanctuary.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Lincoln Park Zoo — Welfare Science Programs</h3>
        <p>
          Their program researches stress indicators, environmental improvements, and 
          specific welfare improvements for certain species.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Lincoln Park Zoo - Conservation Ambassador Board</h3>
        <p>
          Promotes conservation without relying on animal captivity, along with building public awareness about local ecosystems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>My Solution</h2>
      <p>
        While modern zoos have adopted conservation and welfare missions, there are still many  
        issues that remain unresolved. Through the ethical frameworks of Singer, Regan, Pepper, and Jamieson,
        it becomes clear that we should relocate certain species (elephants, big cats, and apes) into proper sanctuaries
        along with designing exhibits that provide privacy and choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        As some institutions have started introducing welfare and sanctuary programs for wildlife, the core structure of 
        zoos hasn’t really changed—they still rely heavily on publicity, control, and confinement. Even though many zoos in
        the U.S. have made progress, there’s still a lot left to address.

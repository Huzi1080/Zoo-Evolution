      <h2>Problematic Patterns within Zoos</h2>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Elephants in Captivity</h3>
        <p>
          Elephants require vast landscapes, social complexity, and the ability to move long distances. 
          In captivity, they often experience joint and foot pain, stress, and abnormal behaviors such as pacing and rocking, which is a sign of stress.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Singer: Emphasizes that captivity causes too much suffering, which needs to be justified</li>
          <li>Regan: Elephants' rights are violated by being held captive</li>
          <li>Pepper: Zoos tend to ignore their need for privacy and space.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Gorillas & Social Stress</h3>
        <p>
          Gorillas, similar to humans, have complex social groups (families), and captivity disrupts their way of life. 
          regardless of zoos trying to improve their exhibits.

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Big Cats in Limited Space</h3>
        <p>
          Despite improvements, most big cat enclosures remain far smaller than their 
          natural ranges, resulting in stereotypic pacing.

      <h2>Examples of Positive Ethical Change</h2>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Detroit Zoo — Elephant Sanctuary Transfer</h3>
        <p>
          Detroit Zoo recognized that elephants cannot live ethically in captivity 
          and voluntarily moved them to a sanctuary.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Lincoln Park Zoo — Welfare Science Programs</h3>
        <p>
          Conducts research on stress indicators, environmental enrichment, and 
          species-specific welfare improvements.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>San Diego Zoo — Habitat-Based Exhibits</h3>
        <p>
          Large, immersive habitats focusing on natural behaviors rather than display aesthetics.

      <h2>Your Philosophical Argument</h2>
      <p>
        While modern zoos have adopted conservation and welfare missions, many structural 
        issues remain unresolved. Through the ethical frameworks of Singer and Regan, 
        it becomes clear that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Some species cannot ethically be kept in captivity under any modern zoo model.</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Proposed Solution: A Sanctuary-Integrated Model</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phase out captivity for elephants, great apes, and large carnivores.</li>
        <li>Redirect funding to wild conservation and sanctuaries.</li>
        <li>Use VR/AR for education instead of live display.</li>
        <li>Promote global habitat protection rather than captive breeding cycles.</li>
